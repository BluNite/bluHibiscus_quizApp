## About

The quiz application is timed and presents the user with random multiple choice questions and answers. A response of "Correct" or "Incorrect" is thrown with alerts and a change in the choice background to reflect the users answer choice. High scores rated can be tracked after the user enters a name. Scores are tracked using local storage web api.

## User Story

As a coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a quiz that is timed using javaScript fundamentals that store high scores,
so that I can track my progress and compare results to peers

## Acceptance Criteria

Given I am using a code quiz app
WHEN I click the start button
Then a timer starts and I am given a set of questions and choices

THEN another question is shown
When I choose the wrong answer
